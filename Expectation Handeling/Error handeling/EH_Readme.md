## Types of Errors

Errors in Python can disrupt program execution or produce incorrect results. They are categorized as follows:

- **Compile-time Errors**: Syntax errors detected before execution.

- **Runtime Errors**: Occur during execution, often as exceptions.

- **Logical Errors**: Code runs but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.
